<h2>Casino Cruise Reviews</h2>

<p>Casino Cruise is a great paypal&nbsp;<a href="https://greatcasino.com.au/paypal-casino/" target="_blank">https://greatcasino.com.au/paypal-casino/</a> online casino. Casino Cruise offers a wide selection of more than 1,300 different games, divided into five different categories. First of all, it is a live casino. Here you will find popular games such as baccarat, roulette and (various variants) blackjack, which are controlled by a real dealer at a real table. You can always see what is happening in the game via a live video link.</p>

<p>In addition, there is an online roulette game where you play virtual roulette. The game is controlled not by the dealer, but by the computer. It&#39;s the same with slots, where you can choose slots from the best developers.</p>

<h2>Bonuses</h2>

<p>The welcome bonus for Casino Cruise is 1000 euros plus 200 free spins. You earn this 1000 euros on four different deposits. You will get the best match for your first Deposit, a maximum of 200 euros, if you Deposit the same amount yourself. The second Deposit will give you 200 euros if you Deposit 400 euros yourself, and the third and fourth deposits will bring you 300 euros of game money for every 1200 euros you Deposit. With your first Deposit, you will get 20 free spins per day for 10 days.</p>

<h2>Bonus conditions</h2>

<p>Always read the small print before requesting a welcome bonus. It&#39;s the same with Casino Cruise. The bonus amount depends on a fairly large wagering of 40 times. This means that you have to bet 40 times the amount equal to the bonus to get the bonus money. If you claim the entire bonus of 1000 euros, this means that you will have to make a big bet to be able to withdraw money at the end.</p>

<p>In addition, the requirements must be met within 14 days, otherwise the entire bonus will expire. In addition, the player is not entitled to receive the bonus at all if the first deposits are made through Neteller and Skrill. So pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Free spins are available for 24 hours and can only be used on NetEnt&#39;s Starburst slot machine. After 24 hours, you will lose all spins that you didn&#39;t bet on.</p>

<h2>Selection of games</h2>

<p>Casino Cruise offers a variety of games, from slot machines, table games, and jackpot games to live gaming platforms. Games are offered by excellent software developers: NetEnt, Microgaming, Play &#39; N Go, Quickspin, Red Tiger Gaming and Nyx Interactive. Live games from Evolution Gaming, the current market leader in live games.</p>

<p>The choice of Board games is also very diverse. This casino is especially recommended for roulette lovers. The site offers more than 20 different roulette options, including Roulette Pro and Cloud Quest Roulette.</p>

<p>When it comes to video poker, the selection is also very extensive: more than 50 games are offered, from classic Caribbean stud poker to the lesser-known red Dog variety.</p>
